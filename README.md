# Weaving

A static site generator that works by running a command, no config (config is optional.)

Markdown, Liquid -> HTML, CSS out.

Simple.

Why weaving? I was looking for a static site generator that was well documented and predictable. Closest I found was Hugo and then I got to thinking- I haven't seen that film with Hugo Weaving in it where he wears a dress for ages.
